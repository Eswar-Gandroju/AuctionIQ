# 🏏 IARS — Intelligent Auction Ready Scout

> **XGBoost-Powered IPL Player Discovery & Comparison Engine**

IARS (Intelligent Auction Ready Scout) is a full-stack AI web application that helps IPL team selectors discover, rank, and compare players using real match data. Built with a Flask + Python ML backend and a React + Tailwind frontend, it combines feature engineering, KMeans clustering, and XGBoost ranking into a clean scouting interface.

---

## 📸 What It Does

- **Filter players** by role, nationality, budget, batting position, bowling type, and more
- **XGBoost ranker** scores every player using impact, consistency, recent form, and cluster type
- **Radar chart comparison** — pit any two players head-to-head with animated overlays
- **Shortlist bucket** — save up to 9 players across sessions using sessionStorage
- **Comparison engine** — full stat table with automatic winner highlighting per metric

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + Glassmorphism |
| Charts | Recharts (RadarChart) |
| Routing | React Router v6 |
| State | React Context API + sessionStorage |
| Backend | Flask + Flask-CORS |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- pip

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iars.git
cd iars
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors pandas scikit-learn xgboost
```

#### Run the ML Pipeline (first time only)

Run these scripts **in order** to generate the processed data:

```bash
python pipeline/players_processing.py
python pipeline/merge_datasets.py
python pipeline/consistency.py
python pipeline/impact_score.py
python pipeline/recent_form.py
python pipeline/clustering.py
python pipeline/add_cluster_labels.py
python pipeline/build_ranker.py
```

This will produce `ranked_players.csv` in `data/processed/`.

#### Start the Flask Server

```bash
python app.py
```

Server runs at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at: `http://localhost:5173`

---

  "batting_position": "Toporder",
  "batting_style": "RHB"
}
```

| `player_type` | string | `"Anchor"`, `"Power Hitter"`, `"Economical"`, `"Wicket Taker"` |
| `batting_position` | string | `"Toporder"`, `"Middleorder"`, `"Lowerorder"` |
| `batting_style` | string | `"RHB"`, `"LHB"` |
| `bowling_style` | string | `"Right-arm"`, `"Left-arm"` |
| `bowling_type` | string | `"Right-arm fast"`, `"Left-arm orthodox"`, etc. |

## 🧮 How the Scoring Works

### Impact Score (0–100)
Weighted formula per role:
- **Batter:** runs (35%) + strike rate (25%) + powerplay runs (20%) + death runs (20%)
- **Bowler:** wickets (35%) + powerplay wickets (25%) + death wickets (25%) + economy (15%)
- **All-rounder:** balanced blend of batting and bowling metrics

### Consistency Index (0–5)
Scaled metric based on runs-per-match × strike rate for batters, wickets × economy for bowlers. All-rounders get an average of both.

### Recent Form Score (0–100)
Computed from the last 2 seasons only. Rewards players currently in form, not just career stats.

### XGBoost Pred Score
Final ranking score trained per role using:
- `impact_score` (40%)
- `consistency_index × 20` (30%)
- `recent_form_score` (20%)
- `base_price_in_lakhs` inverse (10%)

### Player Clusters (KMeans, k=3 per role)

| Role | Cluster 0 | Cluster 1 | Cluster 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Batter / WK | Anchor | Balanced | Power Hitter |
| Bowler | Economical | Wicket Taker | Death Specialist |
| All-rounder | Batting Heavy | Balanced | Bowling Heavy |

## 📋 Raw Data Format

Your CSVs in `data/raw/` should follow these schemas:

**players_raw.csv**
```
player_id, player_name, age, country, role, batting_style, batting_position, bowling_style, bowling_type
```

**base_prices_raw.csv**
```
player_id, base_price_in_lakhs
```

**performance_raw.csv**
```
player_id, season, matches, runs, balls_faced, strike_rate, wickets, overs, runs_conceded, economy, powerplay_runs, death_runs, powerplay_wickets, death_wickets, fifties, hundreds, four_wickets, five_wickets
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes Applied

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `All-rounder` vs `all-rounder` role mismatch | Fuzzy filter in `recommend.py` normalizes hyphens + case |
| `results.map is not a function` crash | Defensive `Array.isArray()` check before every `.map()` |
| Shortlist lost on refresh | Migrated from `localStorage` to `sessionStorage` |
| Player 2 auto-locks on compare page | Empty dependency array `[]` on auto-load `useEffect` |
| Budget filter non-numeric crash | `try/catch` around `float(budget)` in Flask |
